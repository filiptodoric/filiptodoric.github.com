Hi, welcome to my website! I'm Filip Todoric, an ambitious software developer
and budding entrepreneur. I never want to stop learning; I'm extremely passionate
about the newest of technologies and business practices. I find inspiration in fast
growing companies and I hope to run one myself in the future.

Whether its using Java to build a fully networked version of a board game,
building a database management system using SQL Server and Java, python to create
a file transfer system or node.js to create a grade calculator website for
students -- I am always looking to experiment and use the newest technologies
to make simple, useful and reliable software.
