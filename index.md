Iâ€™m Filip Todoric a software developer/engineer/designer. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science 
from Carleton University. I also like to think that I've got solid business instincts. 

I am always looking to experiment and use the newest technologies to make simple,
useful and reliable software. Click the link above to find more about what I'm
working on and what I have built.

My most recent project is [gradecalc.co](http://www.gradecalc.co).
