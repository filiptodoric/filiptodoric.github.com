I’m Filip Todoric, an ambitious software developer and budding entrepreneur.
I’m extremely passionate about the newest of technologies and business practices,
and because of this I find myself constantly learning something new. I find
inspiration in innovative companies and I hope to run one myself in the future.

I am always looking to experiment and use the newest technologies to make simple,
useful and reliable software. Click the link above to find more about what I'm
working on and what I have built.

My most recent project is [gradecalc.co](http://www.gradecalc.co).
