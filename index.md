Hi, welcome to my website! I’m Filip Todoric, an ambitious software developer and
budding entrepreneur. I’m extremely passionate about the newest of technologies
and business practices, and because of this I find myself constantly learning
something new. I find inspiration in innovative companies and I hope to run one
myself in the future.

Whether its using Java to build a fully networked version of a board game,
building a database management system using SQL Server and Java, python to create
a file transfer system or node.js to create a grade calculator website for
students -- I am always looking to experiment and use the newest technologies
to make simple, useful and reliable software.
