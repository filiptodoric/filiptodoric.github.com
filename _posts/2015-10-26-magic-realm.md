**The goal:**
Create a networked, multiplayer version of the classic board game [Magic Realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Realm).
Allow users to travel across the board, find gold, engage in combat and fight
ghosts.  

**The technology:**
Both the client and the server are built using Java and the socket API. Handler
threads handle the networking and boards are synced with every individual player
after each turn. The game was developed along side two of my friends and we used
a agile SDLC. The game was developed across two iterations.

**The result:**
Successful! The game is fully networked and playable. Most of the core game play
from Magic Realm has been implemented.
