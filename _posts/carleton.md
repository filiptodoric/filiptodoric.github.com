title: Carleton Employee Management
category: project

**The goal:**
Create a simple yet capable application to manage Carleton University's database
of employees. Users should be able to add, remove, edit and search for employees
at Carleton University. The database is the basis of a few other internal applications
and this program allows less technical users to manipulate a SQL database.

**The technology:**
The application is written in Java. The database is Microsoft SQL Server. JDBC
is used to connect the two parts of the application.

**The result:**
Refactoring and development is ongoing. The application's core features are
there. However code needs to be refactored and made to be more object oriented.
Test suites would also be a nice addition. However, the application is working
and doing its job. I plan on adding additional functionality to the search bar.
