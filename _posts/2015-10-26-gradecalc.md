**The goal:**
Create a simple application to let students and instructors calculate their grades.
I want users to be able to create profiles where their grades are saved for each
of their classes. Each time the user visits the site they simply input whatever
new grade they received and their new mark will be updated. Using this, they'll
know how hard they'll have to study on the final exam to receive an A+.

**The technology:**
The application is hosted on a VPS running Ubuntu. The web application itself is
using the MEAN stack.

**The result:**
The project is currently in progress. I hope to have it working and hosted very
soon. Many exciting things to come!
