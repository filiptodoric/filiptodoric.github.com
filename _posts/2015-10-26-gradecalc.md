**The goal:**
Create a simple application to let students and instructors calculate their grades.
I want users to be able to create profiles with their classes and grades saved.
Each time the user visits the site all they'd have to do is input whatever new
grade they received and they'll have their new mark. And they'll know how hard
they'll have to study on the final exam to receive an A+.

**The technology:**
The application is hosted on a VPS running Ubuntu. The web application itself is
using the MEAN stack.

**The result:**
The project is currently in progress. I hope to have it working and hosted very
soon. Many exciting things to come!
