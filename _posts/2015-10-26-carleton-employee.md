**The goal:**
Create a simple yet capable application to manage Carleton University's database
of employees.

**The technology:**
The application is written in Java. The database is Microsoft SQL Server.

**The result:**
Refactoring is ongoing. The application's core features are there. However code
needs to be refactored and made to be more object oriented. Test suits would also
be a nice edition. However, the application is working and doing its job.
