**The goal:**
Make a simple website to convince people that I'm a cool guy and businesses to
offer me a job. Create a space where people can get to know me, and learn about
my ongoing projects. 

**The technology:**
Created using Jekyll. Hosted on GitHub pages.

**The result:**
You tell me!<sup><sup>Seriously! Tell me.</sup></sup>
