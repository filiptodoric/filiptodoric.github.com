**The goal:**
Make a simple website to convince people that I'm a cool guy and businesses to
offer me a job. I'll try my best to update the site and continue to provide
more details regarding my personal projects.

**The technology:**
Created using Jekyll. Hosted on GitHub pages.

**The result:**
You tell me!<sup><sup>Seriously! Tell me.</sup></sup>
