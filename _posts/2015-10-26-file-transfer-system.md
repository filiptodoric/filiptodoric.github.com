**The goal:**
Make a multi-platform Bash inspired file transfer system. Using native bash
commands, the user should be able to add, get and create files/directories on the
server from the client computer.

**The technology:**
Both the client and the server are built using Python's socket API.

**The result:**
Successful! Using the application is simple and reliable. The client can
read and write files from the server, regardless of their platform.
