**The goal:**
Create a simple application to let students calculate their grades. I haven't found
a website that works well on mobile and allows me to save grades to my classes.
I really hate having to type them in over and over again. So, I want to build a
mobile friendly website, where I can save grades to classes and gives me all the
information I need without any extra.

**The technology:**

The application is hosted on a VPS running Ubuntu.

Backend: Node.js

Database: MongoDB*

Frontend: JavaScript/jQuery (and obviously HTML + CSS)

So essentially what this all means is a lot of JavaScript was used in the making
of this project. In fact I ended up writing NaN lines of code!

**The result:**
It's working and live on [gradecalc.co](http://www.gradecalc.co). Next step? Listen
to what the users have to say and very possibly build an iOS and Android app.
