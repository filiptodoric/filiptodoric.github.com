I am *almost* done getting my Bachelor's of Computer Science. I'll be graduating
at the end of June 2016.

Beyond school and personal projects I am a **huge** fan of the Ottawa Senators.
I try and watch almost every game (time permitting). Beyond that you can catch me
playing pick up basketball with friends, some shinny hockey at the outdoor rink
or watching Netflix when its gets too cold for either of those.

I am (like almost everyone else) a big fan of music. I always make sure to go to
at least a few music festivals and concerts each year. This summer I had a blast
spending my time at Bluesfest in Ottawa and Osheaga in Montreal. In just a few
days I was able to take in the performances of: Kanye West, Florence and The Machine,
Kendrick Lamar, The Black Keys, Edward Sharpe, and Alt-J.
