I am *almost* done getting my Bachelor's of Computer Science. I'll be graduating
at the end of June 2016.

Beyond school and personal projects I am a **huge** fan of the Ottawa Senators.
I try and watch almost every game (time permitting). Beyond that you can catch me
playing pick up basketball with friends, some shinny hockey at the outdoor rink
or watching Netflix when its gets too cold for either of those.
